**Fshare** is a powerful, open-source CLI tool that lets you share files and directories from your terminal to anywhere in the world with a single command. Built with Python, Flask, and [Pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io), it eliminates the need for complex setups, cloud uploads, or sign-up forms.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before installing Fshare, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Git
- pip (Python package installer)

## Manual Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyberytti/Fshare
```

### 2. Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd Fshare
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Tool

After successful installation, you can run the tool using:

```bash
python3 fshare.py --help
```

## Making Fshare Globally Accessible (Optional)

To use Fshare as a global command (like `apt` or `git`) from anywhere in your terminal, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Nuitka

```bash
pip install nuitka
```

### 2. Create Executable

```bash
python -m nuitka --onefile fshare.py
```

Upon successful compilation, you'll see the message:
```
Nuitka: Successfully created 'fshare.bin'.
```

### 3. Rename the Executable

```bash
cp fshare.bin fshare
```

### 4. Move to System Executables Directory

Move the executable to your system's executable directory:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
sudo mv fshare /usr/bin/
```

**Windows:**
Move the `fshare.exe` file to a directory in your system's PATH, such as:
- `C:\Windows\System32\`
- Or add the current directory to your PATH environment variable

### 5. Verify Global Installation

Test the global installation by running:

```bash
fshare --help
```

You should now be able to use Fshare from any directory in your terminal.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  **🖥️ Local Server:** Fshare spins up a lightweight Flask web server on your machine to serve the selected files.
2.  **tunneling:** It uses [Pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io) to create a secure SSH tunnel, exposing your local server to the internet with a public, random URL.
3.  **🗜️ Smart Archiving:** If you share multiple files or a directory, Fshare creates a temporary `.zip` archive on the fly. This archive is cleaned up automatically when you stop the server.
4.  **🛑 Temporary by Design:** The shareable link is active **only** as long as your Fshare process is running. As soon as you press `CTRL+C`, the server and the tunnel shut down, and the link becomes inactive.

## 🛡️ Your Files, Your Control: Security & Privacy

-   **✅ No Third-Party Uploads:** Your files are streamed directly from your computer to the recipient. They are never stored on any intermediate server.
-   **✅ Ephemeral Links:** Links expire the moment you terminate the session. No forgotten files lingering in the cloud.
-   **✅ You Are the Host:** You have full control and visibility over the sharing process.

## ❓ FAQ

> **Is Fshare free?**

Absolutely! Fshare is 100% free and open-source under the MIT License.

> **Can I share large files, like video exports or disk images?**

Yes! There are **no file size limits** imposed by Fshare. Your transfer speed is only limited by your own network bandwidth.

> **How long do the shared links last?**

The links are temporary and last only until you stop the server by pressing `CTRL+C` in your terminal.

> **Does it work on Windows?**

Yes, Fshare works perfectly on Windows .
