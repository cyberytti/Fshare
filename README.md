**Fshare** is a powerful, open-source CLI tool that lets you share files and directories from your terminal to anywhere in the world with a single command. Built with Python, Flask, and [Pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io), it eliminates the need for complex setups, cloud uploads, or sign-up forms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started in 60 Seconds

### Prerequisites
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed and running.

### Installation
Follow these simple steps to get Fshare up and running.

1.  **Pull the Docker Image**
    ```bash
    # Pull the latest stable version of Fshare
    docker pull sagnikbose/fshare:v1.0
    ```

2.  **Download the Launcher Script**
    ```bash
    # Download the official fshare.sh wrapper
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberytti/Fshare/main/fshare.sh
    ```

3.  **Make it Executable**
    ```bash
    # Grant execute permissions to the script
    chmod +x fshare.sh
    ```
    > **Pro Tip:** Move `fshare.sh` to your system's path (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/fshare`) to run it from anywhere with just `fshare` instead of `./fshare.sh`.

## üö¶ Usage Examples

Once you run a command, Fshare will start a server and generate a public URL. Share this link with anyone. **Press `CTRL+C` to stop sharing.**

### Sharing a Single File
```bash
# Usage
./fshare.sh document.pdf
```

### Sharing Multiple Files
```bash
# Fshare will automatically zip them
./fshare.sh image.png song.mp3 presentation.pptx
```

### Sharing an Entire Directory
```bash
# The 'my_project' folder will be zipped and shared
./fshare.sh my_project/
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **üñ•Ô∏è Local Server:** Fshare spins up a lightweight Flask web server on your machine to serve the selected files.
2.  **tunneling:** It uses [Pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io) to create a secure SSH tunnel, exposing your local server to the internet with a public, random URL.
3.  **üóúÔ∏è Smart Archiving:** If you share multiple files or a directory, Fshare creates a temporary `.zip` archive on the fly. This archive is cleaned up automatically when you stop the server.
4.  **üõë Temporary by Design:** The shareable link is active **only** as long as your Fshare process is running. As soon as you press `CTRL+C`, the server and the tunnel shut down, and the link becomes inactive.

## üõ°Ô∏è Your Files, Your Control: Security & Privacy

-   **‚úÖ No Third-Party Uploads:** Your files are streamed directly from your computer to the recipient. They are never stored on any intermediate server.
-   **‚úÖ Ephemeral Links:** Links expire the moment you terminate the session. No forgotten files lingering in the cloud.
-   **‚úÖ You Are the Host:** You have full control and visibility over the sharing process.

## ‚ùì FAQ

> **Is Fshare free?**

Absolutely! Fshare is 100% free and open-source under the MIT License.

> **Can I share large files, like video exports or disk images?**

Yes! There are **no file size limits** imposed by Fshare. Your transfer speed is only limited by your own network bandwidth.

> **How long do the shared links last?**

The links are temporary and last only until you stop the server by pressing `CTRL+C` in your terminal.

> **Does it work on Windows?**

Yes, Fshare works perfectly on Windows via the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.
